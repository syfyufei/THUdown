  abstract = {Neighborhood organizations have been active partners with cities in service provision for many years, providing an institutional structure for coordinated action to improve their neighborhood environments through coordinated resident action. Cities' needs to relieve fiscal distress are now generating even more interest in direct service delivery by community-based organizations (CBOs). Before these efforts can be substantially expanded, however, much more needs to be learned about the kinds of services amenable to CBO delivery, the kinds of CBOs willing and able to participate, and the most effective administrative arrangements for delivering the service. This paper draws on information obtained from applications for a Federal demonstration program to address these and other empirical questions regarding city and CBO arrangements for service coproduction.The analysis indicates that cities are most likely to rely on advocacy-type organizations to deliver peripheral or supplementary services which are amenable to volunteer labor rather than those which are viewed as essential public services. Cities have yet to demonstrate, on a large scale, a willingness to enter into partnerships which would give CBOs significant responsibilities for core services. For this to occur it will be necessary to support prototype demonstrations of the feasibility of the approach and to expand significantly the capacity of CBOs through technical assistance.}

Design/methodology/approach A systematic review was performed based on 46 papers found in ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases following the Prisma Protocol for the search. Findings The results show that antecedents of coproduction/creation are connected to organizational/institutional capabilities (e.g. codesign of services or trust development) or patient/individual factors (e.g. physical and mental capabilities). The process of coproduction/creation relates with enablers, such as interactive and dynamic relationships between public care service providers and users. Finally, outcomes have diverse nature, namely quality of life, compliance, behavioral intentions, among others. Research limitations/implications This study addresses the overlooked topic of coproduction/creation of value within PHCS. It contributes to public healthcare services literature wherein concepts of coproduction and cocreation of value are still on debate. It contributes to the transformative service research (TSR) by underlining that healthcare factors, processes and approaches may have a positive or negative (value codestructing) influence on the well-being.

While both goals and task significance are important in extant public-management research, a theoretical integration of the variables is needed. This study makes the theoretical contribution of explaining how these variables might work together in a public organization. In addition to examining the relationship between task goal clarity and performance, we consider how task significance might condition the relationship. There are theoretical reasons to suggest both a positive and negative conditional effect. Utilizing a 3\texttimes 2 factorial design, we conducted a laboratory experiment on 214 subjects participating in a task-performance exercise. This study provides experimental evidence that task goal clarity is positively related to performance. However, an interesting relationship emerges with respect to the conditional effect of task significance. When an individual is primed to believe their performance has a higher level of task significance, the evidence suggests that this will decrease their level of performance. The findings provide significant nuance to our understanding of both task goal clarity and performance, as well as our understanding of the relationship between task significance and performance.},

It aims at demonstrating that, while PSM shows the relevance of public values for motivation, SDT explains how context affects it. Taking the two theoretical approaches as complementary to one another and by pointing out their ``static'' and ``dynamic'' features, the framework provides a theoretical foundation for organizational practices aimed at enhancing motivation in the public services. Design/methodology/approach The framework is based on a review of PSM and SDT theoretical concepts and empirical studies; the analysis examines the implications and contributions of each approach to the understanding of motivation in the public services. Findings The paper demonstrates that PSM and SDT are complementary theoretical approaches and that this complementarity can provide clearer guidance to practitioners and widen the understanding of motivation in the public services. Research limitations/implications The framework considers only a few features pertaining motivation in the public services, such as public values, basic needs satisfaction, prosocial behaviour and socialization. Further research should explore additional factors. Practical implications The framework provides an explanation of why some practices are likely to enhance motivation in the public services, while others are likely to deplete it. Originality/value The framework does not limit itself to proposing the theoretical integration of PSM and SDT, but connects this integration to organizational practices.},

Aiming to increase the importance attributed to benevolence values, which reflect the motivation to help and care for others, the intervention combines three mechanisms for value change (self-persuasion, consistency-maintenance, and priming). In three experiments, 142 undergraduates (67\% male, ages 19\textendash 26) participated in an intervention emphasizing the importance of either helping others (benevolence condition) or recognizing flexibility in personality (control condition). We measured the importance of benevolence values before and after the task. In Experiment 1, the intervention increased U.S. participants' benevolence values. In Experiment 2, we replicated these effects in a different culture (Israel) and also showed that by enhancing benevolence values, the intervention increased participants' willingness to volunteer to help others. Experiment 3 showed that the increases in the importance of benevolence values lasted at least 4 weeks. Our results provide evidence that value change does not require fictitious feedback or information about social norms, but can occur through a 30-min intervention that evokes both effortful and automatic processes.},

This practice is posited to contribute to the formation of an Authentic Inner-Compass: An action-guiding schema, informing youth on what they truly value, need, and want, and consisting of two parts: (1) A foundation including authentic values, interests, and life-aspirations, and (2) Autonomous commitment to future-oriented goals and decisions, based on the foundation.

We establish conditions under which the principal reduces the marginal compensation rule to reduce monitoring efforts. As such, peer pressure provides a rationale for a reduced link between compensation and output in a team setting.}

Traditional conceptions of service planning and management are now outdated and need to be revised to account for coproduction as an integrating mechanism and an incentive for resource mobilization\textemdash a potential that is still greatly underestimated.

In his new book, Barry Bozeman demonstrates the continuing need for public interest theory in government. Public Values and Public Interest offers a direct theoretical challenge to the utility of economic individualism, the prevailing political theory in the western world. The book's arguments are steeped in a practical and practicable theory that advances public interest as a viable and important measure in any analysis of policy or public administration. According to Bozeman, public interest theory offers a dynamic and flexible approach that easily adapts to changing situations and balances today's market-driven attitudes with the concepts of common good advocated by Aristotle, Saint Thomas Aquinas, John Locke, and John Dewey. In constructing the case for adopting a new governmental paradigm based on what he terms managing publicness, Bozeman demonstrates why economic indices alone fail to adequately value social choice in many cases. He explores the implications of privatization of a wide array of governmental services\`uamong them Social Security, defense, prisons, and water supplies. Bozeman constructs analyses from both perspectives in an extended study of genetically modified crops to compare the policy outcomes using different core values and questions the public value of engaging in the practice solely for the sake of cheaper food. Thoughtful, challenging, and timely, Public Values and Public Interest shows how the quest for fairness can once again play a full part in public policy debates and public administration.},

In recent years, however, these constructs have been criticized as being ill-defined and ``a catchall'' to represent all forms of cultural differences. The authors argue that there is a conceptual confusion about the meaning of ingroups that constitute the target of collectivism. Collectives are rarely referred to in existing measures to assess collectivism. Instead, networks of interpersonal relationships dominate the operational definition of ``ingroups'' in these measures. Results from a content analysis of existing scales support this observation. To clarify and expand the individualism\textendash{} collectivism distinction, a theoretical framework is proposed that draws on M. B. Brewer and G. Gardner's (1996) conceptualization of individual, relational, and collective selves and their manifestation in self-representations, beliefs, and values. Analyses of data from past studies provide preliminary support for this conceptual model. The authors propose that this new theoretical framework will contribute conceptual clarity to interpretation of past research on individualism and collectivism and guide future research on these important constructs.},

Results indicate that Ss perceived less peer pressure toward misconduct than peer involvement and also were comparatively less willing to follow peers in misconduct. Nevertheless, perceived peer pressure and conformity disposition accounted for more of the variance in self-reported misconduct than in self-reported peer involvement. Age differences were modest and varied among measures and samples. The samples also differed in the magnitude of perceived pressures and conformity dispositions as well as in the degree to which these variables were associated with self-reported behavior. It is concluded that the findings reveal a complexity in adolescent conformity that bears elaboration in future research. (31 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Little research has examined the extent to which these findings apply in other countries or whether the role of significant others varies according to the organization of national educational systems. This article examines the effects of peers' and parents' attitudes regarding academic performance on students' educational aspirations in 12 countries. The results indicate that peers and parents influence educational aspirations in countries with relatively undifferentiated secondary schooling, like the United States, while the influence of significant others is negligible in societies with more differentiated secondary education. In these latter systems, it appears that aspirations are largely determined by the type of school the student attends; there is little room for interpersonal affects. The effects of significant others on students' aspirations depend, in large part, on the structural features of the educational systems in which they operate.}

We interviewed participants in eight community-centered research studies that sampled for endocrine disrupting compounds and that shared research findings with participants. The results of our analysis of participation in these studies indicate that altruistic motivations were commonly held. We found that these sentiments were tied to feeling a sense of connection to society broadly, a sense of connection to science, or a sense of connection with the community partner organization. We develop a new concept of banal altruism to address mundane practices that work towards promoting social benefits. Further, we offer that research altruism is a specific type of banal altruism that is a multi-faceted and important reason for which individuals choose to participate in community-centered research.},

However, the process of citizens' involvement has rarely been investigated in the scientific literature. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on this issue, examining the expectations and perspectives of people involved in an ongoing process of collective public service co-production implemented in Val Brembilla, a small-sized municipality located in North-Western Italy. Design/methodology/approach A mixed research strategy was designed. First, seven focus groups involving both citizens and entrepreneurs participating in public service co-production were established. Second, a semi-structured survey was administered to 463 co-producers (including both citizens and entrepreneurs), in order to elicit their perceptions and expectations. Findings An institutional trigger, namely, the decision of the municipality's board to purchase the Kuwait Expo 2015 pavilion, initiated the process of public service co-production. Although citizens did not fully agree with the decision to buy the pavilion, due to its negative implications on the municipality's finances, they were found to be willing to participate in public value co-creation. The opportunity to promote territorial identity through public value co-creation represented the main driver for citizens and entrepreneurs' involvement. Practical implications Collective public service co-production is a sustainable and effective way to enhance the provision of public services. Several barriers are thought to prevent citizens' engagement in collective public service co-production. First, people expect to be engaged from the initial steps of the process; second, the distinguishing role of territorial identity in influencing citizens' behaviors and expectations should be recognized and properly addressed to avoid shortcomings in citizens' engagement. Originality/value This paper investigates an ongoing collective public service co-production experience; moreover, it highlights the role of public service co-production in enhancing the public sector entities' ability to recognize the evolving needs of the community.},

A crucial task for the policymaker is to identify the set of instruments to be deployed and to integrate them into a policy mix. However, policy instruments not only need to be coherent in their design; their implementation also requires instruments that create interdependence and preserve the integrated logic of the policy mix over time. In this paper we identify the instruments that make integration work. We argue that for policy mixes to solve complex problems, instruments that secure the continued interaction of its components are needed. We show that three instruments serve this purpose: a policy frame, authority, and information. We use three cases where governments have attempted to solve complex problems through policy integration to illustrate our argument. With this paper, we advance our understanding of how integration works and, by doing so, we inform decision-makers about the specific policy tools necessary to achieve it.},

Results revealed that pressure from family, compared to friends, was more powerful for U.S. participants than Indian participants. More pressure increased the likelihood of committing the unethical act and decreased perceived responsibility. However, failing to comply resulted in substantial anticipated social rejection, especially if the unethical act benefits the close other. Although family and friends often teach us good morals, that influence can also open the door for potential unethical behaviors.}

Our findings indicate that PSM, measured in dimensional form, is a moderate indicator of an individual?s sector preference: as PSM increases (particularly, the Self-Sacrifice dimension), the attractiveness of working in the public and nonprofit sector, relative to the for-profit sector, also increases. Focusing on a preservice sample of undergraduate students allows us to conclude that PSM is a need people have prior to entering the workplace, and it may indeed drive whether an individual works in the government, nonprofit, or for-profit sector.}

Recently it has been suggested that value in PSOs is created rather than co-produced through a relationship between the service user and the service provider based on the service user's wider life experience. Importantly, this definition shifts the emphasis from the PSO (the focus of value co-production) to the PSO service user and their wider life experience. This is by no means an agreed conceptualization; there are many and varied definitions of value and its creation process. In this article, we develop a philosophical foundation for the value creation process in PSOs, something we argue is fundamentally missing from current conceptualizations. To do this, we draw on the work of Deleuze and Guattari, repositioning the basis of value co-creation from a service logic to a logic of assemblage. We then apply this framework to a practical example of public service use to show how it can be used to make sense of reality.}

Even under conditions of effortful processing, attitudes toward a social policy depended almost exclusively upon the stated position of one's political party. This effect overwhelmed the impact of both the policy's objective content and participants' ideological beliefs (Studies 1-3), and it was driven by a shift in the assumed factual qualities of the policy and in its perceived moral connotations (Study 4). Nevertheless, participants denied having been influenced by their political group, although they believed that other individuals, especially their ideological adversaries, would be so influenced. The underappreciated role of social identity in persuasion is discussed.}

A confirmatory factor analysis is used with both a diagonally weighted least squares and a modified version of maximum likelihood estimation that are more appropriate for ordinal indicators. Data from the National Administrative Studies Project, consisting of mail surveys of managers engaged in information management activities working in state-level primary health and human service agencies, is used (n = 274; response rate = 53\%). Results indicate good support for the shortened scale compared to Perry's original work. Findings corroborate Perry's theorized dimensions and items in the exploratory instrument. An exploratory analysis evaluating modifications to the tested model suggests possible improvements in two dimensions but does not undermine the overall, supportive results and suggests the importance of continued item and scale development.}

Using descriptive and multivariate statistics, the analyses conclude that there are generalizable and stable differences in the reward motivations of public- and private-sector employees. There is also evidence that public-service motivation in the federal sector is positively related to organizational commitment. In contrast, there is no evidence that public-policy attitudes vary between those who are and those who are not public service oriented.}

We discuss the SDT concept of needs as it relates to previous need theories, emphasizing that needs specify the necessary conditions for psychological growth, integrity, and well-being. This concept of needs leads to the hypotheses that different regulatory processes underlying goal pursuits are differentially associated with effective functioning and well-being and also that different goal contents have different relations to the quality of behavior and mental health, specifically because different regulatory processes and different goal contents are associated with differing degrees of need satisfaction. Social contexts and individual differences that support satisfaction of the basic needs facilitate natural growth processes including intrinsically motivated behavior and integration of extrinsic motivations, whereas those that forestall autonomy, competence, or relatedness are associated with poorer motivation, performance, and well-being. We also discuss the relation of the psychological needs to cultural values, evolutionary processes, and other contemporary motivation theories.}

  abstract = {Self-determination theory (SDT) is an empirically derived theory of human motivation and personality in social contexts that differentiates motivation in terms of being autonomous and controlled. Work leading to the theory began with experiments examining the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. During more than thirty years since the initial studies, we have developed five mini-theories to address different, though related, issues: the effects of social environments on intrinsic motivation; the development of autonomous extrinsic motivation and self-regulation through internalization and integration; individual differences in general motivational orientations; the functioning of fundamental universal psychological needs that are essential for growth, integrity, and wellness; and the effects of different goal contents on well-being and performance. We have subsequently used SDT and its mini-theories to guide and interpret research on many new issues, including motivation and wellness across cultures, close relationships, enhancement and depletion of energy and vitality, and the roles of both mindful awareness and nonconscious processes in behavioral regulation. Although much of SDT was developed through laboratory experiments, it is also supported by a great deal of applied research using both field studies and clinical trials to address significant social issues. We briefly mention some of that work, especially related to health behavior change, education, psychotherapy, work motivation, sport and exercise, and prosocial behaviors.

Socalled principal-agent models of bureaucratic behavior have considerable value. But they are far better at explaining why bureaucrats shirk (goof off on the job), subvert (commit acts of administrative malfeasance), or steal (use public office for private gain) than they are at explaining why bureaucrats behave as ``principled agents''\textemdash workers who do not shirk, subvert, or steal on the job even when the pecuniary and other tangible incentives to refrain from these behaviors are weak or nonexistent. These workers also often perform thankless tasks, go above and beyond the call of duty, and make virtual gifts of their labor even when the rewards for behaving that way are highly uncertain at best. This article explores the cultural basis of behavior in one government agency, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Together with what is known about other strong-culture government agencies, the case of the BOP argues for the efficacy of social, moral, and symbolic incentives in shaping bureaucratic behavior. Rational choice theorists who discount the possibility of publicspirited bureaucratic behavior are wrong, as are any who deny the capacity of agency leaders to create and sustain organizational cultures of principled agents. Future research should explore the general political, administrative, legal, and budgetary conditions under which organizational cultures of principled agents arise, persist, and change.}

This relationship is moderated by the behavior of other group members: high-PSM people act even more prosocially when the other members of the group show prosocial behavior as well, but they do not do so if the behavior of other group members is not prosocial.},

For individuals personally targeted by the campaign, we estimate the reinforcement effect of proximity to other individuals in our sample. For untargeted individuals, we estimate how the campaign diffuses as a function of proximity to others in the sample. We find evidence for both effects that are similar across treatments and proximity measures. The campaign raises the level of interest in the election through networks, in line with the average treatment effect. However, we find a negative network effect of the treatment on voter participation, implying that the positive effect of treatment on more central individuals is smaller. We interpret this result as consistent with free riding through pivotal reasoning and provide additional evidence to support this claim.}

Interviews were conducted with 22 citizens, healthcare practitioners, managers and policymakers all of whom were involved in, or knew about, the original project. Only one direct sustained service change was found - introduction of a volunteer first responder scheme in one community. Sustained changes in knowledge were found. The Health Authority that part-funded development of the community participation method, through the original project, had not adopted the new method. Community members tended to attribute lack of further impact to low participation and methods insufficiently attuned to the social nuances of very small rural communities. Managers tended to blame insufficient embedding in the healthcare system and issues around power over service change and budgets. In the absence of convincing formal community governance mechanisms for health issues, rural health practitioners tended to act as conduits between citizens and the Health Authority.

  abstract = {Purpose In developing countries there is a growing recognition that co-production offers more cost effective and responsive service delivery options in low income areas. The purpose of this paper is to explore the way co-production initiatives are managed in developing country, Pakistan. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative comparative case study design is used. Data are collected through 25 semi-structured interviews and document analysis and applies institutional analysis and development framework for analysis. Findings The study suggests that challenges to co-production are more than a managerial problem which require a different set of capabilities on the part of the actors in order to achieve anticipated goals in the joint production of services. Co-production initiatives require formal structures and processes to involve the local community and third sector to work with the public sector as effective partners. Political and bureaucratic commitment in regional and local government and community willingness to engage act as a catalyst for the successful management of co-production. Originality/value The study extends understanding of what makes co-production work, a less researched area on co-production, drawing on a comparative analysis of two different institutional arrangements of co-production.},

There has been a lack of clarity about how to measure the extent to which organisations are generating public value, which has rendered researchers unable to quantitatively study the causes, consequences and correlates of public value. The current study systematically reviews the growing literature on public value measurement to identify, evaluate, and synthesise available measures. Through a qualitative synthesis of the themes present in published measures, we identify four key components for measuring public value that appear to be important across a range of policy and national contexts. Our review identifies a promising framework that could be used to structure a comprehensive measure of public value and, in doing so, provides a means to progress theoretical development and testing of the public value approach.},

The academic debate has analyzed several facets, but one deserves further analysis: its impact on the cost efficiency of public services.

The SLR approach differs from traditional narrative reviews since, like other meta-analysis methods, it adopts a replicable and transparent process. At the same time, when compared to most common meta-analysis or systematic review logics, it is better suited to incorporate evidence from case studies and etnographies. This makes the method especially suited to public administration and management studies.Findings Results shed light on the nature of the academic literature relating coproduction to cost efficiency, on what type of costs are affected and how and on the meaningfulness of productivity measures when public services are co-produced.Originality/value In times of fiscal distress for many governments, the paper contributes to research and practice in systematically re-assessing the effects of coproduction on public budgets.},

To assess the importance of payoff externalities in the emergence of peer effects, we consider both a piece rate compensation scheme, where pay depends solely on own performance, and a team compensation scheme, where pay also depends on the performance of other team members. Overall, we find some evidence that subjects who are observed increase productivity at least initially when compensation is team based, while we find that subjects observing react to what they see when compensation is based only on own performance.},

We also find evidence supporting the intrinsic motivation crowding out hypothesis, in that, higher extrinsic rewards reduce the propensity of intrinsically motivated individuals to accept public sector employment. This is, however, only true for two segments of the UK public sector: the higher education sector and the National Health Service. Although our findings inform the literature on public service motivation, they also pose the question whether lower extrinsic rewards could increase the average quality of job matches in the public sector, thus improving performance without the need for high-powered incentives.},

This penchant getting augmented one idiosyncratically wants to become everything that he is capable of becoming. This term was familiarized as, an ultimate needs of human beings (Maslow, 1968)in his hierarchy of motivation. It was also defined by various authors in following ways; a life-long process (Rogers, 1961), a way of living (Gowan, 1972), and a challenge (Kerr, 1991) It also discussed in terms of actualizing tendency (Rogers, 1951), the longing, motive, or penchant to live up to the highest level of one's capabilities (Globe, 1970; Goldstein, 1939; Rogers, 1961), having earned recognition in one's field of endeavor (Reis \& Callahan, 1989; Walker, Reis, \& Leonard, 1992), and the individual's urge for self-actualization is not a fixed state, but it is a process of development which does not end.

Our data include information about the performance of individual students as well as their randomly assigned roommates, chosen friends, and chosen study-partners. We find that students with able roommates perform better, and the magnitude of this roommate effect increases when the roommate's skills match the student's academic goals. We also find that students benefit equally from same-and different-caste roommates, suggesting that social similarity does not strengthen peer effects. Finally, although we do not find strong evidence for independent friendship or study-partner effects, our results suggest that roommates become study-partners, and in so doing, affect performance.

A propensity score matching strategy that compares observationally similar individuals finds that participation in school-based service activities for credit increases students' reported prosocial values, such as helping others in the community, one underlying component of PSM-related values. However, taking a civics course does not affect PSM or associated values. The results suggest that PSM-related values are malleable and responsive to early service experiences. The values underlying PSM may evolve over time. That is, the development of prosocial values in adolescence may lead to the future development of other values important to PSM.},

There are several dimensions of status (social, intellectual, etc.). The genesis of status, satisfaction with it, the role of it in behavior, and thoughts about it were surveyed. A self-rating type of scale was then devised and shown to have adequate reliability for 41 cases. In S's use of the scale, the reference group was varied by means of instructions, with resulting shifts in status rating, changes in intercorrelations of the dimensions of status, and changes in reliability of the ratings. Negligible correlations between the ratings and economic radicalism were found. General status is probably a composite of specific statuses.

This question has received considerable attention among scholars and governments, but the causal effect of government initiatives on citizen coproduction has been extremely difficult to measure due to endogeneity problems. Moreover, the literature has devoted limited attention to the important question of which citizens are likely to increase coproduction efforts as a consequence of initiatives (e.g., are the citizens with the greatest need for the service also affected?). I address these shortcomings using a randomized field experiment on publicly provided language support for immigrant children, including more than 600 families. I focus on initiatives that provide citizens with resources relevant for their coproduction. The results show that government initiatives can increase citizens' coproduction, also among the citizens with the greatest need for the service.}

We demonstrate that the decline in trust and engagement has been led by Generation X, rather than the Baby Boomers, who compare quite favorably with their predecessors, the highly lauded `Long Civic Generation.' Baby Boomers do, however, have a more sporadic and short-lived record of civic engagement than the preceding generation. Both social trust and, especially, civic engagement are also subject to consequential life cycle effects that may be disguised in cross-sectional designs. The interdependence between social trust and civic engagement is evident as individuals age, though trust is more a cause than a consequence of civic engagement, and the link disappears for voluntary associations based upon exclusive identities.},

The relation between basic need satisfaction and perceived school performance was fully mediated by autonomous self-regulation. Finally, the students' perceived autonomy support was partly accounted for at class-level, indicating that the students in the same class to some extent had similar experience of autonomy support.

We review evidence for the components of our framework at four levels of analysis: intrapsychic, dyadic, group, and cultural. Within these levels, we consider how phenomena such as altruistic punishment, prosocial contagion, self\textendash other similarity, and numerous others give rise to prosocial behavior.

Little research has examined the relationships between various peer pressure domains and emerging adult substance use. Methods: This study used quantitative data from 359 emerging adults (aged 18-29 years, M = 25.46 years; 60.8\% female; 74.2\% White) to explore the associations between different types of peer pressure (e.g. peer pressure to socialize and peer pressure to use substances) and substance use among a diverse sample of emerging adults. Latent profile analysis and path analysis were used for analysis. Results: Three unique profiles of perceived peer pressure emerged (negative peer pressure, positive peer pressure, and no perceived peer pressure). The negative peer pressure group was more likely to engage in binge drinking, lifetime alcohol use and lifetime marijuana use than the no peer pressure group. The positive peer pressure group was less likely to engage in lifetime alcohol or marijuana use compared to the no peer pressure group. Discussion: Findings suggest that peer pressure is associated with emerging adult substance use, in both negative and positive ways. Results of the current study provide the critical groundwork for more sophisticated studies seeking to understand the pathways by which positive and negative peer pressure impact emerging adult behavior.},

This study provides support for the institutional perspective that PSM can be cultivated through processes of institutional socialization, and suggests that the self-determination theory and the social interdependence theory are useful for understanding the effects of extracurricular activities and peer collaboration on PSM, and that collaborative learning and service-learning will be valuable in cultivating PSM.},

Although some important steps have been taken to both improve and internationalize the PSM scale, this work has been done incrementally. In contrast, this study takes a more systematic and comprehensive approach by combining the efforts of international PSM scholars to develop and then test a revised measurement instrument for PSM in 12 countries. Although the resulting four dimensional 16-item measure of PSM reported here provides a better theoretical and empirical foundation for the measurement of PSM, our results suggest that the exact meaning and scaling of PSM dimensions are likely to differ across cultures and languages. These results raise serious concerns regarding the ability to develop a single universal scale of PSM, or making direct comparisons of PSM across countries.},

The dimensions of the public service motivation construct are refined along the lines of attraction to public participation, commitment to public values, compassion, and self-sacrifice.

This article investigates the relationship between PSM and employment sector in pre- and postentry settings using data from a panel of Danish physiotherapy students surveyed before and after their first job in the public or private sector. The analyses show that PSM is relevant for neither attraction to the public sector nor actual sector of employment. This indicates that within a group of professionals, PSM is probably more associated with the nature of the public service work than the sector itself. Conversely, PSM is found to be severely hampered after job entry, which is interpreted as a shock effect. This effect is also moderated by sector, that is, public organizational membership prevents PSM from declining as much as in the private sector. This suggests that if PSM is associated with sector employment, then it is primarily a consequence of the sector affiliation, but in a more complex way than previously assumed.}

  abstract = {Modern scientific theories of emotional behavior, almost without exception, trace their origin to Charles Darwin, and his publications On the Origin of Species (1859) and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). The most famous dilemma Darwin acknowledged as a challenge to his theory of evolution through natural selection was the incomplete Sub-Cambrian fossil record. However, Darwin struggled with two other rarely referenced theoretical and scientific dilemmas that confounded his theories about emotional behavior. These included (1) the origin of social instincts (e.g., altruism, empathy, reciprocity and cooperation) and the reasons for their conservation in evolution and (2) the peripheral control of heart rate vis-a-vis emotional behavior outside of consciousness. Darwin acknowledged that social instincts are critical to the survival of some species, but had difficulty aligning them with his theory of natural selection in humans. Darwin eventually proposed that heart rate and emotions are controlled via one's intellect and cortical mechanisms, and that instinctive behavior is genetically programmed and inherited. Despite ongoing efforts, these two theoretical dilemmas are debated to this day. Simple testable hypotheses have yet to emerge for the biological mechanisms underlying instinctive behavior or the way heart rate is controlled in infants. In this paper, we review attempts to resolve these issues over the past 160 years. We posit that research and theories that supported Darwin's individualistic brain-centric and genetic model have become an "orthodox" Western view of emotional behavior, one that produced the prevailing behavioral construct of attachment as developed by John Bowlby. We trace research and theories that challenged this orthodoxy at various times, and show how these challenges were repeatedly overlooked, rejected, or misinterpreted. We review two new testable theories, emotional connection theory and calming cycle theory, which we argue resolve the two dilemmas We show emerging scientific evidence from physiology and a wide variety of other fields, as well from clinical trials among prematurely born infants, that supports the two theories. Clinical implications of the new theories and possible new ways to assess risk and intervene in emotional, behavioral and developmental disorders are discussed.},

We test a set of moderation hypotheses using school data (teacher survey data with administrative data on schools and student). Using within-student between-teachers fixed effects regression, we find a stronger PSM\textendash performance relationship in organizational contexts involving greater regulation of employee work autonomy for users with low to moderate user capacity.},

We present the results of a series of tests designed to probe the validity of our version of the Implicit Association Test, which we call the ``Pro-IAT.'' First, we test the Pro-IAT's known groups' validity by administering it to four groups of subjects that theory and empirical evidence suggest differ in their prosocial and public service motivation\textemdash MPA students, MBA students, Mturk adults, and local government employees. Second, we examine correlations between subjects' scores on the Pro-IAT and subjects' survey-based prosocial and public service motivation. Third, we use an online task to test whether subjects' scores on the Pro-IAT are associated with the amount of (real) money they pledge to charity. Fourth, we use a survey experiment to test whether the Pro-IAT is resistant to a randomly assigned social desirability prime. Our tests provide strong support for the Pro-IAT's known groups' validity and modest support for the Pro-IAT's predictive validity. Additionally, they suggest that the Pro-IAT is resistant to social desirability bias and is measuring a different dimension of prosocial/public service motivation than survey-based measures.},

Worker effort is positively related to the productivity of workers who see him, but not workers who do not see him.

Pressing societal challenges are also prompting governments to rethink policy making in order to better align public intervention across policy domains and leverage the transformative potential of system innovations. Governments faced multiple obstacles in implementing a policy mix approach in policy making and evaluation. Based on a comparative analysis of international STI policy repositories, a conceptual framework is proposed, as well as structuring principles and operational guidelines for mapping the composition of a policy mix, identifying interactions among components and translating the mapping into measurement. In that view, a range of new policy mix metrics is introduced. Finally, the discussion focuses on the need for moving towards a new data management paradigm and enlarging the measurement mix.},

By randomizing the order of PSM and outcome questions, PSM may be exogenously activated among survey respondents, and the causal effects of this activation assessed. Drawing on this design and a sample of over 5,000 Chilean central government employees\textemdash the largest experimental PSM survey sample to date\textemdash we find that PSM activation enhances willingness to report ethical problems to management.

Whether these studies accumulate comparable knowledge about PSM crucially depends on PSM measurement invariance: that PSM has a similar measurement structure in different national contexts. Yet, large-scale cross-country research to address this conundrum remains scant. Drawing on an original survey of 23,000 public servants in ten countries in Eastern Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa, our paper addresses this gap. Replicating Kim et al.'s 16-item scale, we find partial metric invariance for the four PSM dimensions in eight countries, but scalar non-invariance. This suggests that results from structural equations about the causes and consequences of PSM may be compared across most countries, yet means of PSM and its dimensions are not generally comparable. PSM research thus cannot adjudicate in which countries public service motivation is higher or lower on average but can compare relationships between PSM and individual characteristics or management practices between countries. Our findings underscore the cross-cultural basis of public service motivation and its limits.},

As our dependent variable, effort intensity in platform use, is a behavioral outcome, we provide insights into the actual behavioral implications of PSM, going beyond self-reports. Using negative binomial regressions, we found a positive relationship between engagement and the PSM dimension ``commitment to the public interest'', and a negative one with the dimension ``compassion''. Additionally, social identification with the city moderates the relationship with engagement for certain PSM dimensions. In sum, our study contributes to a better understanding of what motivations drive citizens to collaborate with public organizations, which is an ongoing trend in many countries around the world.},

We test this in an experimental study of 456 public employees in which treatment groups were asked to recall negative or positive interactions with citizens, before responding to questions from a widely used scale of PSM. Results suggest that expressed PSM is sensitive to, and in fact increases, in response to both positive and negative experiential primes.

This article presents an overview of SDT and reviews its applications to educational practice. A large corpus of empirical evidence based on SDT suggests that both intrinsic motivation and autonomous types of extrinsic motivation are conducive to engagement and optimal learning in educational contexts. In addition, evidence suggests that teachers' support of students' basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness facilitates students' autonomous self-regulation for learning, academic performance, and well-being. Accordingly, SDT has strong implications for both classroom practice and educational reform policies.}

  abstract = {A central question for programs that involve constituents in the coproduction of government services is: what motivates constituents to participate? This study compares two perspectives on this question: the traditional public-as-citizen model treats participation as a function of a general civic disposition that extends to many forms of civic and political participation (e.g. volunteering and voting); and we introduce the public-as-partner model, which argues that a given program might rely on any of the diverse array of human motivations, depending on the specific nature of participation required. We compare these using 311 systems, which provide a hotline and online tools for requesting nonemergency government services (e.g. graffiti removal), evaluating whether using 311 to contribute to neighborhood maintenance primarily reflects a civic disposition or is additionally motivated by a capacity for territoriality (i.e. identifying with and claiming responsibility for spaces), per the public-as-partner model. The study links three forms of information at the individual level for a sample of 311 users from Boston, Massachusetts (n = 722): objective reporting activity, derived from the 311 archive; a user survey including self-reports of civic activities and territorial motives; and voter registration records. Controlling for demographics and the contextual effects of home neighborhood, higher territorial motives predicted a greater likelihood of a person reporting any issues of public concern and reporting more issues over a broader geographical range in one's home neighborhood (where {$>$}80\% of reports are made). Civic activities and voting predicted a greater likelihood of reporting in nonhome neighborhoods (e.g. work). This dichotomy highlights the distinction between the two models in conceptualizing the motivations for participation in coproduction.The article explores how to extend this logic to the assessment of participation, outreach, and disparities in access across programs.},

  abstract = {The ecological integrity of coastal and near-shore environments is at the mercy of social, business, institutional and regulatory norms that dictate human behavior\textemdash not just at sea, but on land. The state of coastal lagoons, estuaries, harbours, semi-closed seas, and even the open ocean, is a mirror of anthropogenic activities on land that: (i) alter or destroy habitat; (ii) pollute groundwater, creeks and rivers that drain into the sea; and (iii) fill the atmosphere with particulates that settle on the sea. Land-based activities, such as mining, clearing vegetation for building roads, homes and hotels, destroy critical habitat and cloud river systems and estuaries with mud and silt. Since the broad range of land-based activities has a cumulative impact on coastal and marine environments, the sustainable development and protection of such environments pose challenges that demand multidisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches and require far more than tough sanctions to punish the environmental ``bad guys''. This paper reviews the strengths and weaknesses of regulatory and non-regulatory options available to governments to manage the destructive and polluting activities of their citizens in coastal and marine environments. It considers the challenge of mixing these options and advocates for a strategic ``cocktail'' of instruments that best suit respective natural, cultural, constitutional and economic scenarios. The paper discourages rushing towards a single untested alternative to traditional command-and-control regulation, but to incrementally experiment with a variety of instruments and combinations thereof. Governments should avoid the tendency to treat various policy instruments as alternatives to one another rather than as potentially complimentary mechanisms. These may include improved regulation, tradable permits, discharge fees and voluntary programmes. The process of incremental experimentation with regulatory alternatives should be paralleled by timely and comprehensive evaluation of effectiveness, efficiency, and their relationship with other components of the broader system. This is the philosophy underpinning the development of National Programmes of Action as required by the 1995 Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities (GPA).},

The findings are robust and suggest that low-intensity efforts to activate PSM have a positive effect on an individual's behavioral inclinations. However, efforts toward the activation of motivation relating to feelings of self-importance appear to engender an effect of similar size.},

This research advances the study of these assertions by creating a scale to measure public service motivation.

The construct is associated conceptually with six dimensions: attraction to public policy making, commitment to the public interest, civic duty, social justice, self-sacrifice, and compassion. Likert-type items are developed for each dimension to create the PSM scale. The measurement theory for the scale is tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

Walzer proposes to democratize the means of distributing welfare services by greater citizen involvement, while Hirst calls for devolving many of the functions of the state to civil society. However, missing from such macro proposals is a micro perspective of citizens co-producers. The first part of this presentation introduces the concept of co-production, with a focus on greater citizen participation in the provision of public services. A review of the literature demonstrates several advantages of co-production, but also some major hurdles. The second part ties the concept of co-production to a discussion of parents' participation in the provision of childcare services in Europe.

This orientation prevails in spite of considerable evidence that many government organizations perform very well, and in spite of many examples of their excellent performance. This article draws on the literature and research on effective government organizations to select and develop conceptual elements of a theory to explain their effectiveness. The available research suggests that such a theory should include the following components: supportive behaviors from external stakeholders such as political authorities; agency autonomy in refining and implementing its mission; high ``mission valence'' (an attractive mission); a strong, mission-oriented culture; and certain leadership behaviors. The discussion further posits that these factors enhance several forms of motivation of people in the agency\textemdash task motivation, mission motivation, and public service motivation\textemdash that can be differentiated but that must be linked together in effective government agencies.}

Then a real-effort experiment is used to test whether mission match is associated with the persistence of individual work effort under conditions of unreasonable performance expectations. Findings show that subjects' narrow identification with the mission of the particular organization on whose behalf they are working is a more important determinant of persistence than the extent to which one reports self-sacrifice as a motivation toward service. Moreover, reported self-sacrifice does not appear to reinforce the relationship between mission match and persistent prosocial work behavior.},

Although the literature has isolated some remedies and causes of unethical attitudes and behaviours, there is a still a need for further research. When focusing on the public context, it has been suggested that the motivation to serve the public interest has a negative relationship with different unethical outcomes. Thus, one interesting avenue of research is to explain how public service motivation can be enhanced by the outcome of certain managerial practices, which may also lead to ethical benefits indirectly. Using data collected from social workers in Catalonia (Spain), this article confirms that goal clarity directly increases the levels of public service motivation and indirectly reduces the acceptance of unethical behaviours by eliciting public service motivation. Research and practical implications of the findings are discussed. Points for practitioners This study highlights the importance of public service-oriented institutional contexts in indirectly shaping unethical outcomes. The findings recommend to public managers and practitioners to provide goal clarity (through certain human-resource management practices such as appraisal or job design) because it increases public service motivation and indirectly reduces the acceptance of unethical behaviour.},

Culture can be a major factor in developing an institution-based theory of public service motivation. In the field of organization theory, culture is considered a fundamental factor for explaining organization behavior. But our review of the literature reveals that culture has not been fully integrated into public service motivation theory or carefully investigated in this research stream. This study starts to fill this gap in the literature by using institutionalism and social-identity theory to predict how the sub-national Germanic and Latin cultures of Switzerland, which are measured through the mother tongues of public employees and the regional locations of public offices, affect their levels of public service motivation. Our analysis centers on two large data sets of federal and municipal employees, and produces evidence that culture has a consistent impact on public service motivation. The results show that Swiss German public employees have a significantly higher level of public service motivation on the whole, while Swiss French public employees have a significantly lower level overall. Implications for theory development and future research are discussed.}

Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed.},

The chapter also highlights how capacities for autonomous self-regulation, although evolved and ``natural'' to all humans, are dependent on both proximal (e.g., familial, interpersonal) and distal (political, cultural, economic) supports, and as how need thwarting aspects of social environments can undermine autonomy and wellness.},

Results showed that all measures constructed for the study were internally consistent. Although all measures of peer pressure, conformity, and popularity were intercorrelated, peer pressure and peer conformity were stronger predictors of risk behaviors than measures assessing popularity, general conformity, or dysphoria. Despite a simplified scoring format, peer conformity vignettes were equal to if not better than the peer pressure measures in predicting risk behavior. Findings suggest that peer pressure and peer conformity are potentially greater risk factors than a need to be popular, and that both peer pressure and peer conformity can be measured with short scales suitable for large-scale testing.},

However, previous empirical studies on co-production have neglected the question of how to make this happen. Moreover, little attention has been paid to how co-production might occur in multi-level governance settings. The aim of this paper is to fill these gaps, identifying triggers, and organizational and managerial issues that could support the adoption of co-production in multi-level governance settings. The empirical analysis is based on a case study of services for autistic children. The findings highlight that co-production was prompted by inter-organizational arrangements and that trust building among the actors played a pivotal role in nurturing a co-production approach. From an organizational perspective, our case study shows that, in order to foster co-production in multi-level governance settings, all stages of the public service cycle should be aligned and inspired by the same logic. From a managerial perspective it highlights that the implementation of co-production requires new managerial skills and tools. Public managers are asked to listen to community groups and individuals, to mobilize collective resources and knowledge, and exercise a meta-governance role. Finally, in order to have co-produced services, our findings point to the need to start thinking differently about the roles of civil society and government in satisfying the common good. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0020852314566008}

Concerns are many in terms of a large number of upcoming retirements, early retirements, unplanned downsizing, difficulty in attracting new generations to public service, and the changing nature of public service. However, the human resource crisis also presents an opportunity to fundamentally change those features of public sector human resource management practices that have become outdated for contemporary organizations and position government agencies for the twenty-first century by meaningfully reforming the civil service. This transformation would require public sector organizations to take a more strategic view of human resource management and to give greater policy attention to human capital issues.},

  abstract = {A principal question in the study of public administration is how to motivate personnel to work in public services and to work towards achieving public purposes. The conceptualisation of the notion of `public service motivation' has provided researchers with openings to explain the disinterested behaviour often displayed by public servants. In a similar way other scholars trying to explain what motivates individuals to take up volunteering activities, struggle to explain disinterested or altruistic behaviour This article examines the contribution that the literature on volunteering can make to a better understanding of public service motivation. The article first, outlines major arguments used to explain why people volunteer and second, explores the extent to which these insights provide a fertile ground for public management scholars to further develop theories of public service motivation. The insight into the multi-dimensional nature of volunteering motivation and the notion of `impure' altruism demonstrate that altruistic activities are both complex and rationally driven. This leads to ways of narrowing the existing gap between rational choice and principal-agent theories of motivation and a purely altruistic view of public service. Finally, the article examines what this implies for the development of human resource policies to obtain and retain committed and motivated staff.}

This article addresses the relevance of co-production under COVID-19 and argues for the need of co-production initiatives to persist well beyond the pandemic. The conditions that made co-production emerge are likely to change, as emergency regulations and funds are abandoned and as the sense of urgency disappears. Areas of public life where there could be a more lasting effect are those where the basic conditions for successful co-production are already in place and where only a push was necessary for co-production to take off. These conditions include basic commitment, complementarity and supportive regulative frameworks, all of which can be sustained beyond the crisis with targeted choices and sufficient support.}

The second, reflected in the work of Burke and colleagues, focuses on the internal process of self-verification. In the present paper we review each of these strands and then discuss ways in which the two relate to and complement one another. Each provides a context for the other: the relation of social structures to identities influences the process of self-verification, while the process of self-verification creates and sustains social structures. The paper concludes with examples of potentially useful applications of identity theory to other arenas of social psychology, and with a discussion of challenges that identity theory must meet to provide a clear understanding of the relation between self and society.}

We ask whether these concepts are equivalent, overlapping, or independent, and whether one concept ''works'' better in an identity theory context. Models relating commitment to role relations to salience and centrality, and salience and centrality to time spent in role, are estimated for four roles and identities related to university students. Results show that identity salience and centrality are independent for some roles, but overlap for others. When they are independent, both are predicted by commitment and both predict time in role, although salience ''works'' somewhat better in these terms. When they overlap, considerable commonality is present in the variance of time in role they explain. Salience again links somewhat better to commitment and time in role, but centrality again contributes to explaining time in role. This study considers when salience and centrality overlap in impact and when they do not, but no clear answer is at hand. Until an answer is available, researchers would be well advised to incorporate both salience and centrality into their designs.}

The aim of this chapter is to present an outline of a theory of intergroup conflict and some preliminary data relating to the theory. It begins with a discussion of alternative approaches to intergroup conflict with special attention to the "realistic group conflict theory" (RCT). RCT's relative neglect of the processes underlying the development and maintenance of group identity and the possibly autonomous effects upon the in-group and intergroup behavior is responsible for some inconsistencies between the empirical data and the theory in its "classical" form. In this sense, the theoretical orientation to be outlined in this chapter is intended not to replace RCT, but to supplement it in some respects that seem essential for an adequate social psychology of intergroup conflict\textendash particularly as the understanding of the psychological aspects of social change cannot be achieved without an appropriate analysis of the social psychology of social conflict. The authors argue that people derive a sense of self-worth and social belongingness from their memberships in groups, and so they are motivated to draw favorable comparisons between their own group and other groups.

Typically, individual characteristics such as age, gender, and income are used to explain why citizens co-produce. In contrast, neighbourhood-level variables receive less attention. Nevertheless, the co-production literature, as well as social capital and urban planning theory, provides good arguments why neighbourhood variables may be relevant. In this study, we examine the administrative records of citizen-initiated contacts in a reporting programme for problems in the public domain. This co-production programme is located in the district of Deurne in the city of Antwerp, Belgium. A multilevel analysis is used to simultaneously assess the impact of neighbourhood characteristics and individual variables. While the individual variables usually found to explain co-production are present in our case, we also find that neighbourhood characteristics significantly explain co-production. Thus, our findings suggest that participation in co-production activities is determined not only by who you are, but also by where you live. Points for practitioners In order to facilitate co-production and participation, the neighbourhood should be the first place to look. Co-production benefits may disproportionaly accrue to strong citizens, but also to strong neighbourhoods. Social corrections should take both into account. More broadly, a good understanding of the neighbourhoods in the city is needed to grasp citizen behaviour. Place-based policies in the city should focus on the neighbourhood.}

Results The conceptualisation of altruism as a value in nursing care in this review strives to describe what altruism is; in what situations does it appear; for what purpose is it used; and how is it practiced. Conclusion Altruism enables nurses to tolerate difficult situations and motivates them to sacrifice themselves and do what is best for the patient, especially when patients are compromised in their ability to care for themselves.},

We combine literature on citizen participation, political efficacy, co-production, volunteerism, public service motivation, and customer engagement to offer a first understanding of citizens' motivations to actively engage as co-producers of public services. Next, empirical data are derived from one specific case: citizens participating in client councils in health care organizations. Q-methodology, a method designed to systematically study persons' viewpoints, is used to distinguish different perspectives citizen have on their engagement in co-production. Our analysis of citizens' motivations to engage in client councils enables us to identify four types of citizen co-producers, which we label: the semi-professional, the socializer, the network professional, and the aware co-producer. Implications for future research studying citizens' motivations in a broader range of co-production cases are discussed.}

Our findings provide tentative behavioral evidence on a linear relationship between PSM and the likelihood of PSRB and a strong positive association with client likeability, which is an asymmetric relationship: Negative affect cues have a larger negative effect than positive affect cues have a positive effect on PSRB. Although our results vary across the three country studies regarding the effects of PSM, overall, the results imply that high-PSM individuals have a tendency to being more likely to engage in PSRB and that clients who are perceived as more favorable will receive a less strict application of bureaucratic rules compared to less favorable clients.}

  abstract = {Public service is a typical form of prosocial behavior. Public service motivation (PSM), a concept proposed back in 1990 as a major research theme in public administration, is a typical form of prosocial motivation and it literally refers to ``the motivation to serve the public''. Literature reveals that PSM is limited within the scope of altruism, which in our view is quite misleading. Prosocial behavior does not have to be driven by altruistic motives. For example, many high-ranking public officials make public policies simply due to media pressure or public scrutiny. Therefore, we use the motivational typology in self-determination theory (SDT) to explore the egoistic side of PSM. From our research findings, we propose and argue that it is unlikely that there is a universal measurement tool for PSM. Scholars need to first identify a given public service behavior, then develop measures to test intrinsic motivation, identified regulation, introjected regulation, and external regulation respectively.}

The current study examined the longitudinal associations between peer pressure and adolescents' cyberbullying perpetration across three years, taking into account moral disengagement as a potential mediator and family socioeconomic status and gender as moderators of the associations. A sample of 2407 Chinese adolescents (Mage at baseline = 12.75 years) completed measurements of peer pressure, cyberbullying perpetration, moral disengagement, and family socioeconomic status at 3-time points with 1-year intervals. The results showed that peer pressure directly predicted subsequent cyberbullying perpetration. Cyberbullying perpetration at time 1 significantly predicted peer pressure and moral disengagement at time 2 only. Moral disengagement played a mediating role between peer pressure and cyberbullying perpetration across time. The relation between peer pressure and moral disengagement was more robust for adolescents with low family socioeconomic status than those with high family socioeconomic status. Compared to boys, girls who experienced high peer pressure at previous time points were more likely to have high peer pressure at subsequent time points. These findings provide a new scientific basis for the intervention of adolescents' cyberbullying perpetration.},

Although the role of trait anger in cyberbullying perpetration has attracted attention in the research literature, it is unclear the temporal sequence between trait anger and adolescents' cyberbullying perpetration and whether stressful environments could interact synergistically with trait anger to create a profile of the particularly severe risk to adolescents' cyberbullying perpetration. This study contributed to existing knowledge by examining the longitudinal and reciprocal relationships between trait anger and cyberbullying perpetration and exploring whether peer pressure and family economic stress would moderate these relationships across 2 years (3 time points) with a cohort of Chinese adolescents ( N = 2,407, M age = 12.75 at baseline). The cross-lagged model revealed that prior trait anger was associated with later self-reported cyberbullying perpetration ({$\beta$} T1 \textrightarrow{} T2 = 0.09 and {$\beta$} T2 \textrightarrow{} T3 = 0.10), whereas earlier self-reported cyberbullying perpetration was not associated with subsequent trait anger. Peer pressure moderated the link between trait anger and self-reported cyberbullying perpetration. Family economic stress did not play a moderating role in the link between trait anger and self-reported cyberbullying perpetration. Findings suggest that cyberbullying perpetration prevention and intervention programs should attach importance to adolescents' trait anger and the way of getting along with their peers.

Half the Ss had the feedback self-administered, and half had it administered by the experimenter. After puzzle-solving, Ss were left alone with additional puzzles and magazines and were observed to see if they worked on the puzzles.
